# `puid`, like [`cuid`](https://github.com/ericelliott/cuid)

**Please refer to the [main project site](http://usecuid.org) for the full rationale behind CUIDs.**

Almost all of the rationale stands except than with an puid, you can vary the initial character (or prefix) -- it's not just a fixed `c`.

My use case is that I want to use that character as a type hint. Purely
a visual thing. 

NB You can easily break the URL-Safety that CUIDs guarrantee by using stupid prefixes. I define this as user error, the puid library makes no attempt to stop you from doing this.

Otherwise the library and implementation is compliant and marginally faster than the other Go implementation.

## install

```
$ go get github.com/thechriswalker/puid
```

## use as a tool

If your `$GOPATH`/`$GOBIN` is all setup, then you should be able to run

```
$ puid
pj34aln7t0000cars6wqeent6
$ puid d
dj34alh5d0000carshj2ctw8e
$ puid foo: bar:
foo:j34al93s0000carskgw1gt3q

## use as a lib

docs [on godoc.org](https://godoc.org/github.com/thechriswalker/puid)

or see [`cmd/puid/main.go`](cmd/puid/main.go)

or run `puid -example`

## customization the generator

More customization can be made to the id generator, you can supply a custom fingerprint, random data source, or counter as well as the prefix. see the docs for info
